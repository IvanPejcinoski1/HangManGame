# Frontend Mentor - Hangman game

## **About Hangman**

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. The objective is simple: guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Each incorrect guess brings you closer to completing the "hangman" drawing, symbolizing the loss of the game.

In this digital adaptation, the traditional pen-and-paper format has been transformed into an engaging and interactive web application. The game includes multiple categories, ensuring a fresh and exciting challenge every time. Features such as real-time feedback, progress tracking, and sound effects enhance the user experience while preserving the charm of the original game.

This project aims to bring a modern twist to a timeless classic, blending entertainment with creativity and technology. Whether you're a fan of movies, animals, or sports, there's something for everyone in this version of Hangman!
